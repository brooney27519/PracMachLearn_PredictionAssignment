# PracMachLearn_PredictionAssignment
Final Project for Practical Machine Learning Course

Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively.  This analysis will use data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to quantify how well they do specific exercices.  The data comes from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

Six young health participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, with one set of 10 repetitions as follows:
1)	exactly according to the specification (Class A)
2)	throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
3)	lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
4)	lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
5)	throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
